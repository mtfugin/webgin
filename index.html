        <h1>Welcome to GIN's HTML Page</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, welcome to my page! My real name is Amerogin, and most people call me 'Gin'.
            But you can call me any nickname you want! About my academic background, I am currently pursuing my 3rd year
            of Bachelor of Science of Computer Science at Sultan Kudarat State University - Isulan Campus here in my province.

        <p> Although I am still exploring different fields in my enrolled program, I somehow stumbled nowhere in
            the world of Web Development. And to tell you, Web Development isn't that new to me anymore because I once
            ventured to it when I was still young (About 8 to 12 years old I think). And what happened was I lost on track
            due to my other focus on Academic (which I was only just on my exploration before, and ended up not so interesting anymore).</p>

        <p> As I write this line more, it feels like I want to delve into Web Development more. But to be honest, I just wanted to
            create experience using this and I wanted to test out my skills further in Web Development. This also gives me a way to
            showcase my artistry (which is my another passion) and somehow gain more insights on what Web Dev offers more. And to be added,
            this also can open an opportunity for me to get known, build my online profile/portfolio, and boosts me up towards the umbrella
            industries of Information Communication, Software Engineering, and Computer Science (which can help me build a career and
            develop myself.)</p>

        <p> So to conclude, I would like you to know that I am all out and excited of every possible things I could with this. I am
            rooting to myself, take acccount of my own progress, and gain more knowledge and experience with the guidance of one of the
            successful indivual in the industry, sir Carl Andrew, the Founder of Icreatechs.</p>

        <p> This is Gin's journey, what begins. XOXO!</p>
